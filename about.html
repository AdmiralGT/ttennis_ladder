    <h2>The Table Tennis Ladder</h2>
	<p>You can play anyone you want at any time if you both agree. Simply enter the initials of both players and select the corresponding winner.
       The rankings will immediately be updated. Only one person needs to put the results in.</p>
    <p>You can play as many or as few games as you want. There is no challenge system - just enter results when you happen to play someone.
       You don't have to play at all - it's a living rankings page with no end date.
       If you don't want to be involved, your name will disappear from the rankings when you aren't part of the last 500 games.</p>
    <p>A "game" is first to 11 points, and singles only.</p>
    <p>If you play many games in the same session, even if against the same person, you can enter them all.</p>
    <p>It's Elo-based.  When your first result is entered you'll appear, starting from 1600 points.</p>
    <p>And yes, anyone can abuse it by making up results and entering them, but please don't do that, it's quite a pain to fix. And it wouldn't be in the spirit, would it?</p>
    <h2>Booking the table</h2>
    <p>The table tennis area can be booked in outlook.  Create an appointment in outlook and select "Table Tennis/Pool" as the room.</p>
    <h2>Table maintenence</h2>
	<p>Please do not use the bats to scoop/flick the balls off the table or floor. We think this is causing the rubbers to come loose and is damaging all the bats.
	Instead, retrieve balls without the bats touching the table.</p>
    <p>Please help to keep the table clean by giving it a wipe down every once in a while.</p>
	<p>Please take care not to spill food or drink on the table.</p>
    <p><a href="player.html?ATN">ATN</a> has bought some balls with a small table tennis budget, so will keep them topped up.</p>
